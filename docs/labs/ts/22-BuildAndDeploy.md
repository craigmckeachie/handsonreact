## Objectives

- [ ] Build a React Application
- [ ] Deploy the application to a web server

## Steps

### Build a React Application

1. **Open** a `command prompt` (Windows) or `terminal` (Mac).
2. Change the **current directory** to `keeptrack`.
3. **Run** the following command to install the node.js web server named `serve`:
   ```shell
   npm install -g serve
   ```
4. **Run** _one_ of the following commands:
   #### npm
   ```shell
   npm run build
   ```
   #### Yarn
   ```shell
   yarn build
   ```
5. After the build finishes, verify a `keeptrack\dist` directory was created.

### Deploy the application to a web server

1. **In** the `command prompt` (Windows) or `terminal` (Mac) **run** the following **command** to **start** a **web server** and serve up the contents of the `dist` directory created in the last step.

   ```shell
   serve dist
   ```

   > Assuming you would like to serve a state site, single page application or just a static file (no matter if on your device or on the local network), the package `serve` is a web server that serves static content.

   > It behaves exactly like static deployments on https://vercel.com so it's perfect for developing your static project.

   > For more information see: https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve

1. The **output** should be as follows.

   ```
   Serving!
   ...
   Copied local address to clipboard!
   ```

1. **Open** a new browser tab and **paste** the local **link** copied to the clipboard in the last step into the address bar.

1. You should **see** the **application** **running** in your browser.
1. **Click** on **Projects** in the **navigation menu **on the top of the page and the list of projects should be displayed.

   > If you see the following **error message** **displayed** your backend is likely shut down. Run the command `npm run api` to restart the backend.

1. After navigating to the projects route, **refresh** your **browser**.
1. You should **see** a **404 error** page.
1. Use `Ctrl+C` to **stop** the **web server**.
1. **Start** the **web server** again but add the `-s` flag for single-page-application.
   ```shell
    serve -s dist
   ```
1. Follow these steps to verify the server is now redirecting to `index.html` when it can't find a route.
   1. **Visit** the root of the site `http://localhost:5000/`
   2. **Click** on **Projects** in the **navigation menu **on the top of the page and the list of projects should be displayed.
   3. After navigating to the projects route, **refresh** your **browser**.
   4. You should **see** the projects page refresh and display the **projects**.
      > Note that you are no longer getting the 404 error page.

### &#10004; You have completed Lab 22

> If time permits you can [read the documentation provided to deploy the application](../../17-BuildDeploy.md) on common production web servers and cloud platforms including Nginx, Apache, IIS, AWS, and Azure.
